Proof of concept of KYC process among banks using Ethereum

As part of my blockchain learning jouney, i have been trhough many articles and listening blockchain guru's and made my hands dirty in learning Hypderledger Fabrick. And made an attempt to get certified from IBM as a Developer. Did more research and learned to get my hands dirty on deploying a small poc for "invoice documenation process" on AWS using AWS Hyperledger Fabric templates, and amazed on the cost effective solution provided by AWS. And made myself more aware on the offerings provided by AWS and became AWS Certified Solutions Architect @ associate level. With all these learning gave lectures on blockchain within my org and for my clients.

However, my recent step towards deep dive in my learning path ; joining IIITB PG course enriched and enhanced my learnings. I added more falvor in my cooking and made an attempt to host KYC process on Ehtereum. I am happy to see the results as i was awarded 99.4% by the institute. Ofcouse , more to come as i need to complete the course which runs for next few more months.

Here i am providing a copy of problem statement, solution and the source code to share my learning and quick screen shots.
