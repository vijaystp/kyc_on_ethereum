Proof of concept of KYC process among banks using Ethereum

As part of my Blockchain learning journey, i have been through many articles and listening Blockchain guru's and made my hands dirty in learning Hypderledger Fabric. And got certified from IBM as a Developer. Did more research and learned to get my hands dirty on deploying a small poc for "invoice documentation process" on AWS using AWS Hyperledger Fabric templates, and amazed on the cost-effective solution provided by AWS. And made myself more aware on the offerings provided by AWS and became AWS Certified Solutions Architect @ associate level. With all these learning gave lectures on Blockchain within my org and for my clients.

However, my recent step towards deep dive in my learning path ; joining IIITB PG course enriched and enhanced my learnings. I added more flavor in my cooking and tried to host KYC process on Ehtereum. I am happy to see the results as i got 99.4% by the institute. Ofcourse , more to come as i need to complete the course which runs for next few more months.
Here i am providing a copy of problem statement, solution and the source code to share my learning and quick screen shots.

The smart contract is written in solidity and deployed , executed on RemixIDE. Detail steps are in the instructions file.

I also create multiple peers and added into the network in the Truffle environment. Detail steps are in the instructions file.
