Proof of concept of KYC process among banks using Ethereum

As part of my Blockchain learning journey, I have been through many articles, listening Blockchain gurus and made my hands dirty in learning Hypderledger Fabric. I got certified from IBM as a Developer. Did a lot of research and learned deploying a small poc for "invoice documentation process" on AWS using AWS Hyperledger Fabric templates. Amazed on the cost-effective solution provided by AWS and made myself more aware on the offerings provided by AWS. I am now an AWS Certified Solutions Architect @ associate level. With all these learnings,  gave lectures on Blockchain within my org and for my clients.

However, my recent step towards my learning path ; joining IIITB PG course, enriched and enhanced my learnings. I added more flavor in my cooking and tried to host KYC process on Ehtereum. I am happy to see the results as I got 99.4% in my assignment. Ofcourse , more to come as I need to complete the course which runs for few more months. Here I am providing a copy of problem statement, solution and the source code to share my learning and quick screen shots.

The smart contract is written in solidity and deployed & executed on RemixIDE. Detail steps are in the instructions file.

I also created multiple peers and added into the network in Truffle environment. Detail steps are in the instructions file.
